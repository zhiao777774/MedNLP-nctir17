NTCIR-17 MedNLP-SC provides the following data.
* [UPDATED] Social Media (SM) Corpus
	Training set: ntcir17_mednlp-sc_sm_train_26_06_2023.zip (containing 7964 tweets in four CSV files (ja, en, de, and fr), respectively).
* [UPDATED] MedTxt-RR Corpus
	Training set: ntcir17_mednlp-sc_rr_train_26_06_2023.zip (containing 109 files: 108 reports (.txt) and one CSV file containing the labels for the reports). 
	Validation set: ntcir17_mednlp-sc_rr_val_26_06_2023.zip (containing 55 files: 54 reports (.txt) and one CSV file containing the labels for the reports).

## Social Media (SM) Corpus
Each sample in the corpus consists of train_id, text, and 22 labels (one for each of the 22 symptoms). Note that "train_id" numbers are randomly assigned, and they are separate from the test IDs. Although some numbers may be missing, it should not be a problem. 

We have identified and fixed some problems in the training set:  
* Some samples seemed to be partially translated, although the labels would still fit
* Some samples were grammatically correct but lacked semantic coherence
* Samples assigned with wrong labels 

[UPDATED] Also, we removed five samples from the initial training data, since they were grammatically and semantically incorrect. 


## MedTxt-RR Corpus
Similar to the SM corpus, we have conducted a thorough review of the MedTxt-RR Corpus, and identified and fixed several errors:
* Minor typos that might affect cancer staging prediction by the model
* Reports assigned with wrong labels

[UPDATED] We have added 36 radiology reports to enhance the available training/validation data
[UPDATED] We have provided an official validation set
