NTCIR-17 MedNLP-SC provides the following training data.
* [UPDATED] Social Media (SM) Corpus: ntcir17_mednlp-sc_sm_train_08_05_2023.zip (four csv files (ja, en, de, and fr))
* MedTxt-RR Corpus: ntcir17_mednlp-sc_rr_train_31_03_2023.zip (99 files: 98 reports (.txt) and one csv file concerning the labels for the reports) 

## Social Media (SM) Corpus
The data consists of id, text, and 23 labels (22 symptoms + other). Note that "id" numbers are randomly assigned, and they are separate from the test IDs. Although some numbers may be missing, it is not a problem.

We have fixed some problems in the training data that we had identified.  

* Some French translations do not contain <user_name> anymore, only "<" remains.
* Some translations seem to miss a part (mostly French) but the labels still fit
* JA docs get translated into a question or other form of statement but the labels still fit
* Some docs are grammatically correct but do not make any sense

We continue to manually verify and update the training data by the final version release on June 24, 2023.

 ## MedTxt-RR Corpus
As with the SM corpus, we have reviewed some of the data and identified some errors for the MedTxt-RR Corpus. 
We will fix the errors and update the data by the final version release on June 24, 2023. Also, we will add the reports.
